        Time: 12:00 PM EST<br>
        Dear Client,<br> 
        On 11/25/2022 an attempt was made to access your account from an unknown IP Address (54.875.24.152). In an effort to protect your personal and financial information we have temporarily locked your account. This includes the ability to withdrawl funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        The access attempt was blocked prior to the unauthorized individual (or individuals) gaining access so, at this time, your personal and financial information remains secure. If this attempt was made by you, or you authorized the third party access, we apologize for the inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in order to unlock your account and protect the integrity of your personal and financial information, you must pass a security check. Also note that this is a time sensitive matter. You must complete the security check within 72 hours of the date of this email.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should you choose not to comply, your account will be permanently locked and any funds contained therein will be forfeited.
    </p>
    <p>To begin, please:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right click on the <a onclick=""javascript:return false;"" href=""http://fakepaypal.com"">link</a> <strong>PayPal Member Security Services</strong></li>
        <li>Open the page in a secure (private) browser window.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions provided.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Please note that PayPal will never ask for your password over the phone, nor ask you to send your login credentials via email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Don't wait. Protect your information and unlock your account within the next 72 hours to avoid the loss of your account and forfeiture of funds.</strong>

      Dear Chase Account Holder,
    </p>
    <p>
      You are receiving this email as a courtesy notification as we have just noticed a charge to your Visa card that is outside your normal 
      spending patterns. For your account safety and security we have prevented this charge from completing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please verify that you are still in possession of your card and log into your account by clicking the link below and verify if the charge 
      is correct or not. If you are aware of this charge you may disregard this email and we will allow the charge to proceed after 2 hours time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, please do this as soon as possible to ensure no fraudulent charges occur on your account. The best way to stop fraud is by 
      preventing it before it happens!
    </p>

        <p>We're gearing up to release our 2023 State of the Phishing Report on January 22. Join us on January 29 for a deep dive into the data from our newest report.</p>
        <p>This report analyzes data from tens of millions of simulated phishing attacks sent through Secarmour's Security Education Platform over a 12-month period, and an extensive survey of our database of infosec professionals on their experience with simulated and real attacks.</p>
        <p>We've also surveyed thousands of end users in the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, and Japan, measuring their knowledge and behavior around phishing, ransomware, and more.</p>

        <p>Dear Jane,</p>
        <p>The University of Arizona is conducting a study on the general perception of America's government. Despite your political stance, we can all agree that a government needs to be legitimate for proper and just functioning at all levels. To accomplish this, you, as a citizen, must hold government officials accountable to ensure transparency. Our study aims at analyzing this consensus.</p>
        <p>We need your help in spreading word about our study and helping in the data collection process.</p>
        <p>For more information about our study and how you can participate, please click <a onclick=""javascript:return false;"" href=""http://www.sgpp.arizona.edu/research/008/about/"">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi Jane,</p>
            <p>
                My name is Roger, and I am a member in your community devoted to raising awareness about animal cruelty and 
                injustice. I have put together a petition for all of our neighbors to sign, in an effort to end domestic 
                animal abuse. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have second thoughts about signing my petition, reconsider the rights of your own pets at home. You 
                can find the <a onclick=""javascript:return false;"" href=""https://petition.org/om12das3md2o"">petition here</a>. Simply putting your name on the form will make the 
                difference we need to ensure the safety and rights of all our pets.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>

        <p>This is Jenny, from the Tucson Farmer's Market! You came to my stand and purchased some of my fresh honey. We briefly talked about our passion for clean and pure honey before exchanging emails.</p>
        <p>I was thinking maybe we could meet up for a cup of coffee or lunch. I believe we can be great friends! Please visit my blog to discuss your love for honey with some of my other friendly patrons.</p>
