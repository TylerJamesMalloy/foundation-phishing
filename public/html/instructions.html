                    <h1> Experiment Instructions</h1>
                    In this experiment you will be determining if example emails are safe (called ham) or if they are phishing emails. When reviewing emails as being potentially phishing emails, pay attention to the following features of the emails to ensure you guess correctly.

                            <b> Real Sender Does Not Match the Claimed Sender: </b> Phishing emails often pretend to be from reputable companies but you can usually spot a fake by checking the email address that sent the message. If the 'from' address is a series of numbers, an odd mix of characters, or isn't the official domain of the company it claims to be from, it's likely a phishing attempt.

                        <li>
                            <b> Email Requests Credentials: </b> Legitimate companies will never ask for your sensitive information via email. If the email requests your username, password, credit card information, or other sensitive data, it's a phishing attempt.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>
                            <b> Suspicious Subject Line: </b> Phishing emails often use alarmist, threatening or enticing subject lines to grab your attention. If the email subject is odd, generic, or doesn't match the content, it could be a phishing email.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>
                            <b> Urgent Tone: </b> Phishing scams often create a sense of urgency, to panic you into acting without thinking. If an email asks for immediate action, like "Your account will be suspended unless you update your information," it's likely a scam.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>
                            <b> Offers: </b> If an email contains an offer that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Phishing emails often lure victims with rewards, discounts, or prizes in exchange for providing personal information.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>

                            <b> Link Does Not Match the Text: </b> One common phishing tactic is to disguise a dangerous link with innocent-looking text. Hover your cursor over any links before clicking. If the URL doesn't match the link text, or if it looks suspicious in any way, do not click. For instance, if the link text reads "bank.com" but hovering over it shows "hackingsite.com", it's a phishing attempt.
