                    <h1> Payment Instructions</h1>
                    <p>Read all emails closely to determine if they are phishing emails or not, randomly pressing yes or no during the trial may result in no payment.</p>
                    <p>During the experiment you will be reading emails and determining if they are phishing emails or not. Your response to this yes or no question will be used to determine your payment.</p>
                    <p>For completing this experiment you will recieve a base payment of $5.</p>
                    <p>Each time you correctly identify an email as being either a phishing email or not a phishing email, you will recieve a point.</p>
                    <p>When you fail to identify an email as being safe or a phishing attempt, you will lose a point.</p>
                    <p>You will recieve a bonus of $0.25 per point at the end of the experiment. There will be 60 trials in total, and the maximum bonus will be $15 for a total payment maximum of $20.</p>
                    <p>When you click continue, you will see 10 emails that may or may not be phishing emails, you won't be told whether you are correct on these 10 trials. After this, there will be 40 trials where you are told if you are correct or incorrect. Finally there will be 10 additional trials where you will not be told. The point total for the bonus applies to all trials.</p>
                    <p>These questions still count to your point total and payment total.</p>
